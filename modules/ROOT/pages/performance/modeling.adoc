== Converting data from DataFrames to graphs

When taking any complex set of DataFrames and preparing it for load into Neo4j, you have two options:

* Normalized loading
* Cypher destructuring

This section describes both and provides information on the benefits and potential drawbacks from a performance and complexity perspective.

[NOTE]
**Where possible, use the normalized loading approach for best performance and maintainability.**

=== Normalized loading

Suppose you want to load a single DataFrame called `purchases` into Neo4j with the following content:

```csv
product_id,product,customer_id,customer,quantity
1,Socks,10,David,2
2,Pants,11,Andrea,1
```

This data represents as simple `(:Customer)-[:BOUGHT]->(:Product)` graph model.

The normalized loading approach requires that you create a number of different DatafFrames: one for each node label and relationship type in your desired graph. For example, in this case, you might create three DataFrames:

* `val products = spark.sql("SELECT product_id, product FROM purchases")`
* `val customers = spark.sql("SELECT customer_id, customer FROM purchases")`
* `val bought = spark.sql("SELECT product_id, customer_id, quantity FROM purchases")`

Once these simple DataFrames represent a normalized view of 'tables for labels' (that is, one DataFrame/table per node label or relationship type) - then the existing utilities provided by the connector for writing nodes and relationships can be used with
no additional Cypher needed.
Additionally -- if these frames are made unique by identifier, then the data is already
prepared for maximum parallelism. (See parallelism notes in sections below.)

==== Advantages

* Normalized loading approach shifts most of the data transform work to Spark itself (in terms of splitting, uniquing, partitioning the data).  Any data transform/cleanup work should be done in Spark if possible.
* This approach makes for easy to follow code; eventually, the write of each DataFrame to Neo4j is quite simple and requires mostly just
a label and a key.
* This allows for parallelism (discussed in sections below).

==== Disadvantages

* You need to do more SQL work before data is loaded into Neo4j.
* This approach requires identifying graph schema before beginning, as opposed to loading data into Neo4j and using Cypher to manipulate it
afterwards.

=== Cypher destructuring

Cypher destructuring is the process of using a single Cypher statement to process a complex record into a finished graph
pattern. Let's look again at the data example:

```csv
product_id,product,customer_id,customer,quantity
1,Socks,10,David,2
2,Pants,11,Andrea,1
```

To store this in Neo4j, you might use a Cypher query like this:

```cypher
MERGE (p:Product { id: event.product_id })
  ON CREATE SET p.name = event.product
WITH p
MERGE (c:Customer { id: event.customer_id })
  ON CREATE SET c.name = event.customer
MERGE (c)-[:BOUGHT { quantity: event.quantity }]->(p);
```

In this case, the entire job can be done by a single Cypher statement. 
As DataFrames get complex, the Cypher statements too can get quite complicated.

==== Advantages

* Extremely flexible: you can do anything that Cypher provides for.
* If you are a Neo4j expert, it is easy for you to get started with.

==== Disadvantages

* Cypher destructuring approach tends to shift transform work to Neo4j, which is not a good idea as it does not have the same infrastructure to support that as Spark.
* This approach tends to create heavy locking behavior, which violates parallelism and possibly performance.
* It encourages you to embed schema information in a Cypher query rather than use Spark utilities.

== Converting data from graphs back to DataFrames

[NOTE]
**In general, always have an explicit `RETURN` statement and destructure your results.**

A common pattern is to write a complex Cypher statement, perhaps one that traverses many relationships, to return
a dataset to Spark. Since Spark does not understand graph primitives, there are not many useful ways to represent a raw node,
relationship, or a path in Spark. As a result, it is highly recommended not to return those types from Cypher to Spark, focusing instead on concrete property values and function results which you can represent as simple types
in Spark.

For example, the following Cypher query results in an awkward DataFrame that would be hard to manipulate:

```cypher
MATCH path=(p:Person { name: "Andrea" })-[r:KNOWS*]->(o:Person)
RETURN path;
```

A better Cypher query which results in a cleaner DataFrame is as follows:

```cypher
MATCH path=(p:Person { name: "Andrea" })-[r:KNOWS*]->(o:Person)
RETURN length(path) as pathLength, p.name as p1Name, o.name as p2Name
```
