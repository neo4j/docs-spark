.List of available read options
|===
|Setting name |Description |Default value |Required

|`query`
|Cypher query to read the data
|_(none)_
|Yes^*^

|`labels`
|List of node labels separated by colon.
The first label is to be the primary label.
|_(none)_
|Yes^*^

|`relationship`
|Type of a relationship
|_(none)_
|Yes^*^

|`schema.flatten.limit`
|Number of records to be used to create the Schema (only if APOC is not installed,
or for custom Cypher queries provided via `query` options).
|`10`
|No

|`schema.strategy`
|Strategy used by the connector in order to compute the Schema definition for the Dataset.
Possible values are `string`, `sample`.
When `string` is set, it coerces all the properties to String, otherwise it tries to sample the Neo4j's dataset.
|`sample`
|No

|`pushdown.filters.enabled`
|Enable or disable the PushdownFilters support.
|`true`
|No

|`pushdown.columns.enabled`
|Enable or disable the PushdownColumn support.
|`true`
|No

|`pushdown.aggregate.enabled`
|Enable or disable the PushdownAggregate support.
|`true`
|No

|`pushdown.limit.enabled` label:new[v.5.1]
|Enable or disable the PushdownLimit support.
|`true`
|No

|`pushdown.topN.enabled` label:new[v.5.2]
|Enable or disable the PushDownTopN support.
|`true`
|No

|`partitions`
|This defines the parallelization level while pulling data from Neo4j.

*Note*: as more parallelization does not mean better query performance, tune wisely in according to
your Neo4j installation.
|`1`
|No

4+|*Query specific options*

|`query.count`
a|Query count is used only in combination with `query` option. This is a query that returns a `count`
field like the following:
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:BOUGHT]->(pr:Product)
WHERE pr.name = 'An Awesome Product'
RETURN count(p) AS count
----

or *a simple number* that represents the number of records returned by `query`.
Consider that the number passed by this value represents the volume of the data pulled off Neo4j,
so use it carefully.
|_(empty)_
|No

4+|*Relationship specific options*

|`relationship.nodes.map`
|If it's set to `true`, `source` and `target` nodes are returned as Map<String, String>, otherwise we flatten the properties by returning
every single node property as column prefixed by `source` or `target`
|`false`
|No

|`relationship.source.labels`
|List of source node labels separated by colon.
|_(empty)_
|Yes

|`relationship.target.labels`
|List of target node labels separated by colon.
|_(empty)_
|Yes
