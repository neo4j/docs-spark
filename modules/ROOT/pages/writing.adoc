= Writing to Neo4j

:description: The chapters describes writing methods to a Neo4j database using Neo4j Spark connector.

The connector provides three data source options to write data to a Neo4j database.

.Write options
[cols="1, 2, 2, 1"]
|===
|Option|Description|Value|Default

|`labels`
|Use this if you only need to xref:write/labels.adoc[create or update nodes] with their properties, or as a first step before adding relationships.
|Colon-separated list of node labels to create or update.
|_(empty)_

|`relationship`
|Use this if you need to xref:write/relationship.adoc[create or update relationships] along with their source and target nodes.
|Relationship type to create or update.
|_(empty)_

|`query`
|Use this if you need more flexibility and know how to xref:write/query.adoc[write a Cypher query].
|Cypher query with a `CREATE` or `MERGE` clause.
|_(empty)_

[TIP]
====
You can run the xref:reading.adoc#examples[read examples] for each option to check the data after writing.
====

[#example-labels]
=== `labels` option

Write the `:Person` nodes.

[#save-mode]
== Save mode

Regardless of the write option, the connector supports two save modes for the data source `mode()` method:

* The `Append` mode creates new nodes or relationships by building a `CREATE` Cypher query.
* The `Overwrite` mode creates or updates new nodes or relationships by building a `MERGE` Cypher query.
** Requires the `node.keys` option when used with the `labels` option.
** Requires the `relationship.source.node.keys` and `relationship.target.node.keys` when used with the `relationship` option.

== Type mapping

See xref:types.adoc[] for the full type mapping between Spark DataFrames and Neo4j.

== Performance considerations

Since writing is typically an expensive operation, make sure you write only the DataFrame columns you need.

For example, if the columns from the data source are `name`, `surname`, `age`, and `livesIn`, but you only need `name` and `surname`, you can do the following:

[source, scala]
----
df.select(df("name"), df("surname"))
  .write
  .format("org.neo4j.spark.DataSource")
  .mode(SaveMode.Append)
  .option("labels", ":Person")
  .save()
