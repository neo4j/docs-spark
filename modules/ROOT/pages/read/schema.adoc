= Schema inference

Since Neo4j is essentially schemaless while Spark DataFrames use a fixed tabular schema, the Spark connector uses a schema inference system to convert graph data into DataFrames.

. If APOC is installed, the connector uses the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/apoc/current/overview/apoc.meta/apoc.meta.nodeTypeProperties/[`apoc.meta.nodeTypeProperties`^] and the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/apoc/current/overview/apoc.meta/apoc.meta.relTypeProperties/[`apoc.meta.relTypeProperties`^] procedures.
You can xref:performance/tuning.adoc#sampling-adoc[tune] both.
. If APOC is not installed, the connector uses the first _n_ results (defined by the `schema.flatten.limit` option) of an additional Cypher query to infer the schema by the type of each column.
When using the `query` option, the schema is inferred from the result of the query itself.

Both methods use sampling, which is the default value (`sample`) of the `schema.strategy` option.
The exact APOC procedure or Cypher query depends on the read option.

This strategy works when all instances of a property in Neo4j have the same type.
Otherwise, the connector still attempts to infer a schema but it logs a message like the following:

[source]
----
The field "age" has different types: [String, Long]
Every value will be casted to string.
----

In this case you should xref:read/define-schema.adoc[define a schema] instead.

[#labels]
== `labels` option

If APOC is installed, the connector uses the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/apoc/current/overview/apoc.meta/apoc.meta.nodeTypeProperties/[`apoc.meta.nodeTypeProperties`^] procedure.
Otherwise, it executes the following Cypher query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:<labels>) <1>
RETURN n
ORDER BY rand()
LIMIT <limit> <2>
----
<1> `<labels>` is the list of labels provided by the `labels` option.
<2> `<limit>` is the value provided by the `schema.flatten.limit` option.

The schema is then inferred from the query result.

[#relationships]
== `relationships` option

If APOC is installed, the connector uses the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/apoc/current/overview/apoc.meta/apoc.meta.relTypeProperties/[`apoc.meta.relTypeProperties`^] procedure.
Otherwise, it executes the following Cypher query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (source:<source_labels>)-[rel:<relationship>]->(target:<target_labels>)  <1> <2> <3>
RETURN rel
ORDER BY rand()
LIMIT <limit> <4>
----
<1> `<source_labels>` is the list of labels provided by `relationship.source.labels` option.
<2> `<target_labels>` is the list of labels provided by `relationship.target.labels` option.
<3> `<relationship>` is the list of labels provided by `relationship` option.
<4> `<limit>` is the value provided via `schema.flatten.limit`.

The schema is then inferred from the query result.

[#query]
== `query` option

With the `query` option, the connector uses the first _n_ results (defined by the `schema.flatten.limit` option) of the query result to infer the schema.

For example, if the read query is `MATCH (n:Person) WITH n LIMIT 2 RETURN id(n) as id, n.name as name`, the connector runs the following query first:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person) WITH n LIMIT 2 RETURN id(n) as id, n.age as age <1>
ORDER BY rand()
LIMIT <limit> <2>
----
<1> The original read query.
<2> `<limit>` is the value provided via `schema.flatten.limit`.

The schema is then inferred from the query result.

If the query returns no data, sampling is not possible.
In this case the connector creates a schema from the `RETURN` statement, with every column of type `String`.
This does not cause any issues since the result set is empty.
