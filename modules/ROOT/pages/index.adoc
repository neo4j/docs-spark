= Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark
:description: This chapter provides an introduction to the Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark.
:page-aliases: overview.adoc

The Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark provides integration between Neo4j and Apache Spark.

You can use the connector to process and transfer data between Neo4j and other platforms such as xref:databricks.adoc[Databricks] and several xref:dwh.adoc[data warehouses].
Based on the Spark DataSource API, the connector supports all the programming languages that Spark supports.

== Graphs and DataFrames

The connector uses _schema inference_ to convert Neo4j graphs into Spark table-based DataFrames.
For example, consider a graph with the following schema:

image::example-graph.svg["Example graph"]

The connector creates a DataFrame with `:Customer` and `:Product` nodes connected by the `BOUGHT` relationship, along with any node or relationship properties.
The xref:read/schema.adoc[] section shows a more detailed example of this process, while the xref:types.adoc[] section shows how data types are mapped between Neo4j and Spark.

The connector supports writing DataFrames to Neo4j as well, and custom Cypher queries both for xref:read/query.adoc[reading] and for xref:write/query.adoc[writing] data.

== Compatibility

=== Neo4j compatibility
The connector supports Neo4j 5.x and 4.4, whether run as a managed service in link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/aura/[Neo4j Aura], as a single instance, or as a cluster.
It supports both the Community and the Enterprise Edition.

=== Spark and Scala compatibility

The connector currently supports Spark 3.0+ with Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13.

== Training

An introduction to the connector by Andrea Santurbano is available on YouTube.
